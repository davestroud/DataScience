## 1. Warm Up: Brief Financial Data
```{r}
# a. Summary of Sample EU Stock Market data set
head(EuStockMarkets)
```

```{r}
# b. Create a rudimentary plot of the DAX
plot(EuStockMarkets[,"DAX"], col="blue")
abline(v=1997, col="red")
abline(v=1998, col="red")
```

```{r}
# c. Decompose the time series into its components 
EU_DAX <- decompose(EuStockMarkets[,"DAX"], type = "multiplicative")
plot(EU_DAX, col="blue")
```

## 2.	Temperature Data
```{r}
# a. Use the maxtemp dataset granted by loading fpp2
library(fpp2)
library(dygraphs)
library(xts)
```

```{r}
# b. We are only concerned with information after 1990
ts <- window(maxtemp, start=1990)
autoplot(ts, xlab="Year", ylab="Temperature (Celsius)")
```

```{r}
# c.	Utilize SES, Simple Exponential Smoothing, to predict the next five years of maximum temperatures in Melbourne. 
fit<-ses(ts, h=5)
