```{r}
# a. Import yob2016.txt and assign to df
df <- read.table('yob2016.txt',header = FALSE, sep = ';')
# Change column names
names(df)[names(df) == "V1"] <- "Name"
names(df)[names(df) == "V2"] <- "Gender"
names(df)[names(df) == "V3"] <- "Amount"

```

```{r}
# b. Display the summary and structure of df
summary(df)
str(df)
```

```{r}
# c. find three y's at the end of a name

```

```{r}
# d. Remove misspelled name and assign data set as an object: y2016

```


### 2. Data Merging
```{r}
# a. Import yob2015.txt file
y2015<- read.table('yob2015.txt',header = FALSE, sep = ',')

# Change the column names
names(y2015)[names(y2015) == "V1"] <- "Name"
names(y2015)[names(y2015) == "V2"] <- "Gender"
names(y2015)[names(y2015) == "V3"] <- "Amount"
```


```{r}
# b. Display the last ten rows in the data frame
tail(y2015,10)
# It is interesting that the names are all Male and there are 5 names of each

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
