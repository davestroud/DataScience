google	Taylor B	2018-03-04T08:36:07Z	1	I'm on hold over an hour after 2am.  I heard someone scream on the phone, then it went back to elevator music!  They clearly don't care anymore.
google	Stephanie Papais	2018-03-01T17:31:36Z	1	"Google, by far, is one of the worst customer service experiences that I've had. They have a shady and manipulative trade in process. Even after sending my phone with evidence (picture and video) that there was NO damage upon shipping AND addressing it with them prior that I didn't feel the packaging was sufficient, I wasn't given the full value of my phone and after a month, all they could offer is $50 store credit. After a month of demanding to see evidence of the claims since they started saying the screen was broken and then that there were dead pixels, they circled back to the same thing after ""escalating"" it to who knows who and having us wait without an update or semblance of intelligence behind the resolution. The entire process proved that Google doesn't care about it's customers and holds unethical practices that are fraudulent and shady. I would never trust them with anything again and I would never advocate to use their products either."
google	1001524	2018-03-01T16:48:39Z	5	This review is strictly a review on the search engine that Google provides and has been the go to  search engine for most if not all my questions and it has rarely let me down. Most answers are straightforward with the first link usually being what I am looking for with certain exception. The only problem with the search engine would be the fact that you can pay for your site to be the first links and its lack of anonymity. Although they do this, these sites are usually relevant to what I am looking for and as for privacy it is something that has been taken away with social media in general so I don´t think its fair to rate the search engine badly just because everything isn´t deleted after searched.
google	Sheema88	2018-02-26T19:01:57Z	3	Good for research and such but I don't like the monitoring! INVAISION OF PRIVACY
google	Charlotte Hennessy	2018-02-20T20:23:01Z	1	Excluding reviews for the search engine Google's service in relation to tangible products is shockingly bad to the point where their own staff say their external delivery service is poor and they take no responsibility. 8 weeks waiting for a delivery and Google couldn't care less
google	Brian V	2018-02-17T22:05:17Z	1	Worst customer service I have ever had. Took them 6 weeks and 5 phone calls to send me a Google home mini. I am not happy and considering getting rid of my pixel 2 xl and cancelling my play account and Gmail. I have never experienced such poor customer service. Good luck if you buy something and need to deal with an issue. Every answer is 'oh I'm sorry for your frustrations I completely understand, let me see what I can do'
google	Yaroslav	2018-02-16T15:15:26Z	3	Use it as my main search engine and for emails. Fine but the surplus of intrusive advertising gets the most of it. However, I can understand the need to pay for all the services but it is still possible to lay off the pedal a bit.

If you manage to go into your account and request "" A GOOGLE CALL BACK .? Your phone rings "" WITH HELD NUMBER "" Thank you for requesting a Google call back "" SOME STUPID MACHINE "" which then cuts you off .

google	Chris	2018-02-02T19:44:08Z	1	Google home mini is Useless. Google support and devices are not good. Google home mini doesn't do what it says it does. It's a scam. Speak to support and they just fob you off. Promise to call back never do. They say they will email you they never do. I. Going to Amazon. Sorry Google your a scam and A joke.

google	IsleDance	2018-01-24T22:44:57Z	1	Google are not communicative and is not in the least concerned about businesses, just their money.Their 'Contact Google' is a joke - probably goes to a centre in Swaziland or somewhere.If you have an issue, don't bother contacting them - just switch to Edge, Facebook or anything else.  Don't ever expect a reply.Emancipation is great!

I was formally a Samsung note user. I should have stuck with it. It does not all the features I need and to make matters worse, it is full of spam. It reminds me of Explorer and it's annoying ads popping up at inopportune times and on the phone they often obfuscate thing you need like answer the phone, turn off alarm and so on. The only way to get around them is to use the google assistant. There have been several other encounters throughout the years, but this is not the place and time. I will never do business with Google again unless they ""the only store in town."""

google	Carey Harrison	2017-12-24T17:52:35Z	1	I am tired of google printing reviews that have nothing to do with my business or the products I offer.  Letting a person with an ulterior motive such as they are upset that I don't offer a restroom fill out a negative review and than google posts it just makes me want to contact a lawyer about google printing it without contacting me, the owner, and leaving a bad mark on my business because I have a septic system problem and central district health has posted a sign out front of my business. Both of the negative reviews I have received have had to do with a restroom situation.  I would appreciate it if google will remove my business from their database unless they will erase my 2 negative reviews over a situation which is beyond my control. Ponderosa Sports & Mercantile.  Horseshoe Bend, Idaho
google	Stuart Wright	2017-12-22T16:44:49Z	2	Very disappointing response from the Google Business Support team. Think twice before adding your company to the Google reviews option. You have been warned! As you will later discover, anyone (even a child!!!) can add a completely false review on your site, marking all your hard efforts down, and there is nothing you can do about it! So working hard to get good customer reviews is a complete waste of time
google	Dani	2017-12-22T16:09:13Z	2	Google has many services and products, some are amazing such as youtube and google search engines, But if you dealing with google for advertising or selling products on their sites then you are for a rough ride, its nearly impossible to speak to a person if you have any issue with your services such as business related, you are on your own or you can send a message and hope for a reply which could takes 3-5 days and that may not even sort your problem and you have to send another message and wait for another reply. Somehow many businesses are only relying on google and once you run into a problem it could take weeks before you can sort it out as help is minimum, Thats the problem when a company has no credible competition,

Endless messages about privacy and review or something else. Their hopeless Email service and the disappearing messages and comments on youtube that never appear except when you are logged in yourself. In the end you don't comment on youtube anymore. Waste of time. But surely there must be someone rich enough to compete with Google? Someone to put these people out of business now?? Someone, anyone? In my next life I prey I will be.
google	Gj	2017-12-14T20:26:47Z	1	Google told me if I had a faulty device I would receive a replacement whilst holding onto my faulty one.A new replacement would be sent then I would send the faulty one back.Now I've spoken to them again they want to hold onto my funds a week before Christmas and say for me to be without those funds till they receive my faulty device back. They then release the funds.Total joke and never thought they would be so terrible with customer service.

google	Daniel	2017-12-04T00:15:17Z	1	"My Nexus 6P, like that of many others, suffers from a battery defect that causes it to shut down without warning at battery levels above 15%. Google has acknowledged this wide-spread defect for months and even replaced other owners' out-of-warranty devices with new Pixels. In my instance, they are refusing to do anything, citing a new policy against doing anything for devices outside of their warranties. For a ""premium"" device to ship with a defective battery that fails after one year is an outrage. Google's refusal to stand behind their flagship device is absolutely unacceptable and their ""support"" has shown no interest in helping this customer."

Mind you, regular calls and emails to their support team - 2-3 times a week and I get zero legible response, or on the phone they say they can't help me but their experts will reach out by email, and I'm sent an automated email telling me that my business page is suspended, like thanks I know that's what I'm trying to fix."

They view you as a product and not a customer to most of the services.  From play store to google Fi to Gmail/Drive.

Gmail insecure and obtrusive.Do not buy a Pixel phone, they are a nightmare.Google pixel is an utter nightmare: I am on my third replacement since December 2016 due to faulty phones which my poor phone company replaced because google take no responsibility.  The claim in shops that you can get 7 hours use from 15 minute charge is a lie, knowingly made.   Recurring problems with battery, phone mike, Bluetooth, wifi.  Google Assistant is totally unreliable as it works intermittently 10%. Of time.Google support utterly unhelpful.Buyer beware of the pixel phones.

I bought ticket to a concert over Craigslist and payed the ""person"" over Google Wallet. Long story short, never received the tickets and I thought my $180 was lost forever. The next day I called Google Customer Service to see if they could just put her username on the watch list so this didn't happen to anyone else. They told me not to worry and opened an investigation to ensure that I was actually scammed. No more than 24 hours later Google sent me an email saying my money would be put back into my account in 3-5 days. Throughout the entire process every person I was in contact with made me feel calm, respected, and at ease. Thank you Google for giving me such a wonderful experience."

google	IHeartOnlineShopping	2017-05-25T11:25:59Z	5	"I am a power user on the Internet. I multi-task all the time and I need to be able to find what I am looking for quickly and easily without an hesitation. Google is my favorite search engine. I've tried them all. Google doesn't give you the awful advertising like Bing and it doesn't give you the scattered results like Yahoo. I have always been able to find what I want on Google without too much work on my part which is nice. I know a lot of people get frustrated with Google because they cannot find what they are looking for. I think part of that is people try to ""change"" what they want to find into words Google can understand. The thing is, Google doesn't work like other search engines, you can ask it a question like a human being, and it can find you an answer like a human being. You don't have to know computer lingo or any other codes to get the answer that you want from Google. For instance, if you want to know all of the movies that star a certain celebrity instead of typing ""movies that star (celebrity name)"" you can simply type ""celebrity name movies"" and get a list.One of my favorite parts about Google is how versatile the search is. If someone sends you a picture on the Internet that you think might be fake, you can click on images, drag and drop the photograph to Google, and find out if they just pulled the photograph right off the Internet. I love the image search because you can use it for just about everything. For instance, I found a black bug in my house with white spots, and I typed black bug with white spots into Google and then clicked images, and there are photographs of tons of bugs. All I do is click on the one that matches what I found, and I can instantly identify the bug. This is just one example of the way to use the image search. I also really like the news search feature on Google. If there is a specific news topic that you need to research you can type the topic in, click on news and it will give you a huge list of applicable news articles from sources all over the internet. They don't just pick and choose a few select ""approved"" news sources, but instead they give you every news source you can think of, even local news. The shopping search on Google is also very nice because it gives you a price comparison within Google without having to visit multiple websites. I love that I can see the price of an item at any store from E-bay to Walmart and every store in between. This allows me to shop for the best price every time I make a purchase without searching dozens of websites. I've compared prices on my own vs searching for prices under the Google shopping search and only once did I find a lower price on my own as opposed to the prices that Google showed. The books search is one of the most valuable. It will actually search parts of books and then highlight the phrase you searched for in that book. It's invaluable for research when you need to quote your sources. I don't know how I ever got through college without it (because it didn't exist back then). The maps are also something that I love, from locating a new restaurant to getting driving directions to the doctor's office, I love that I can type in any location in the world, click on maps, and get a map of the location and/or driving directions to and from the location. It incorporates Google Earth type technology, but loads faster and easier, and it's available on the Internet vs downloading Google Earth to your computer. Google is close to perfect, which is saying a lot for a search engine. The one thing I would change is the fact that it stores pages that no longer exist. I've found ways around this, by submitting removal requests for information, but at the end of the day, I wish Google could check for web pages that no longer exist so that I did not have to click on multiple websites only to find out that the information is no longer thereI will continue to use Google as long as it's superior to other search engines, and I don't see that changing any time soon!"

They share all your data and if you make a search on your phone, related advertisements will show up on your laptop 1.000 km away! They also put more and more paid search results ahead of organic results every day. It is shameful.

google	Petro	2017-04-28T20:53:50Z	1	Hi everyone, I bought a pixel XL 128gb for my wife for around $1000, phone worked for one month and then just broke, wasn't turning on. Google service asked to send them everything that came with a phone. So we did and as a replacement they send us different repaired phone not even including a charger. Such a waste of time and money. Disappointed in Google.
google	Michael	2017-04-22T21:30:04Z	1	Disgraceful. My disabled autistic son purchased some in-app purchases on google play without my permission. He didn't know what he did was wrong, so i contacted google about this and changed my password and took my debit cards off. The refused to refund me even though i spoke to a forum in which 200+ people replied saying they got refunds for unauthorized purchases. So it seems Google refused me because my son is disabled!! Disability discrimination at it's finest.
google	Jurgen	2017-04-22T20:35:48Z	5	I bought a Google Pixel phone which had a problem with the screenafter2-3 month. After I have proven that I did not drop the phone I hadthe most professional exchange service ever. I called Google service on Monday morning and had my replacement the next day. I also got 7 daysto transfer my files onto the new phone and were able to send back my old phone at no costs.This is what I call a first class service! S h*t can happen but if you know, you dont need to worry than this is a company you can go for at any time!
google	John Borkenhagen	2017-04-22T14:22:20Z	1	My credit card showed Fraudulent charges for Google Services.  10 charges showed up within a few minutes.I called Google support.  They said the charges did not come from my account, but my credit card was used.  I asked Google support what product or service my card was used for.  Google support said they were unable to tell me.  My on line AmEx account had additional information including seller ID and Google Services transaction number, but Google support was not interested in that information.I asked to talk to the supervisor.  I gave all the same information to the supervisor and got the same responses.  He said he was the end of the line and no one else at Google could help me.  He was pleasant and apologized for the inability for Google to provide any help with fraudulent Google Services charges.I called AmEx after getting off the phone with Google.  They gave me the name of the Google services business that made the charges.  It was in China and fraudulent charges from multiple other credit cards were also made to the same China company.  The credit card number, expiration date, and security code were all used for the fraudulent charges.  AmEx fraud department is working the case.  I am guessing someone sold a database with credit card info to the China company.Google has as much or more compute power than AmEx.  Google should use some of its compute power to do the same fraud detection and prevention for Google Services that American Express.  I will avoid doing any card transactions through Google whenever possible until they get serious about providing value add to their services.

google	American Eagle	2017-04-01T14:34:04Z	1	Three tech support staffers could not fix google assistant app on a 5 days old Pixel 128GB phone. They had the nerves to offer me a refurbished(used) phone as a replacement for my new phone. One of them when I mentioned may be I should file a lawsuit against Google he said to go a head and a Google attorney will contact me. This is my  10th Google device that I purchased in the last three year. You can tell I am a google guy. I paid close to $5,000.00 for Google devices and at the end I get an offer for a used replacement  and to  go to hell if I don't like it. At this time Google will never a penny out of me and it is time to switch to Apple at this time and I will on my next phone. By the way I fixed the phone without Google's lack of competence and knowledge of there own phones.

We phoned Google and we emailed google to tell the m that we do not the people that gave us a bad review and that these people had no evidence pictures or otherwise to justify such a review. Their email replies below are exactly what the culture of the this egotistical company is about. Theys till have not replied to my request to removed altogether from the review systemWe do not know these individuals as they are not our clients and we do not have their addresses. for us to take them to Court, which is what Google are asking a small business like ours to do. Instead of investigating these people who gave us a bad review with no evidence at all.So how do we pursue someone in a court of law that we do not know. We do not know who these reviewers were or their addresses. So Google has a legal and moral duty to remove these reviews as Google themselves have no evidence that these people have a right to do a review on our Company. They never ever visited our premises so their review is false.I am sick of Google and I am going to remove Fleur De vie entirely from your review systems and I am now going to reveal this case to Trust Pilot and any other review platforms I can get hold of. Google has to be exposed for its corrupt policies about reviews once and for all.They are refusing to remove my company from their search engines, why? They are like bullies that do what they want.Google have to be exposed for what they are they make the rules up as they go along. They are without doubt a Company that lacks common sense and ethics do not exist.entirely. They have made money by mistake and luck. The owner should be put in front of a Parliamentary Committee to answer these questions I am asking them.Fleur De Vie wrote to Google:You have allowed unknown persons to make reviews about our Company who have never had any services from our Company.How on earth can you justify this????????Please can you let me know how to remove our company entirely from the Google Search engines and review systems.I await your reply with urgency.It is yourselves that should be pursued in court as we can prove that these people have never ever been to outré shops so how can you justify not removing these reviews.""Richard JojoFleur  De Vie-----Original Message-----From: removalsSent: 17 February 2017 14:36To: Subject: Re: [8-3678000015850] Your Request to GoogleHi,Thanks for reaching out to us!We have received your legal request.

Please note that Google reviews are a forum for users to share both positive and negative opinions. At Google, we try to help our users find and learn about places that they are looking for in the physical world. User reviews help users learn about a business, so we do not remove reviews unless they violate our policies. We also will not be removing the entire business listing from Google Maps, nor can it be removed.If your business received a review that you don’t agree with, we encourage you to use business owner responses to reconcile the situation with the customer. We know a negative review can be frustrating, but we believe that engaging with a customer to address his or her concerns creates the best environment for our community.Regards,The Google Team________________________________________Let me tell you we had asked for the false and corrupt review to be removed and then we asked for ourselves then toi be removed in view of their disgusting attitude towards small enterprises that are being slandered at the hands of Google. Google can not even answer our queries without lying and asking us to take these people to court when we do not have their address is remarkably lie a kangaroo state.It beggars belief that Google actually think in this way.They are stating above that they will not remove my business from Google and that they do not have to.

For a reason that google could never explain, my google account had a hold that prevented me to buy apps through credit/debit cards and also did not allow me to redeem gift cards.It all started on a Wednesday where I made my first call. In that call they told me that they had to pass the case to another department and the process to solve it would take about 24 hours when they would send me an email indicating the solution. 24 hours later I call again since I had not heard from them. At this time I was told the same thing as the first time. I told them that my impatient to resolve the case was to buy some apps that were special for thanksgiving dates, but they tried to reassure me by saying that these specials usually lasted throughout the Christmas season. Again they told me to wait 24 hours where they were supposed to contact me with the solution. 24 hours later they did not answer. I go back and I call, on this occasion I was told ""Wait always has its rewards"" to fall in love with they... This time I was told to wait 12 hours for the final answer. 12 hours later I call again, this time the customer service told me sharply ""anyone who calls every day will not expedite or solve the problem"" and to top this he told me to wait 3 days for the solution. LOL, I laugh because to summarize, I had to create another account to redeem the gift card but it was to late, the apps had gone up in price. Ironically, within 2 days of doing this I get an email from google saying that they had already solved the problem of my account ... 2 WEEKS AND HALF to solve this. THAT'S WHY APPLE IS APPLE ..."

In theory you can change your settings to prevent Google services any access to your data,but this requires removing all your Google accounts from the net,without which you can no longer use the majority of the most popular and useful features and sites.Try to do a simple little thing as per Googles ""helpful"" step by step instructions and you'll be going round in circles looking for the listed next option that doesn't come up on your screen as described in Googles instructions and will be guaranteed to accomplish little more than give you a great big migraine!From what I've seen of Googles dealings and read in the small print under their ""terms and conditions "", you may as well sell your soul to the devil,a terminology not wasted with its irony on someone who has come to the conclusion Google may very well be the  Antichrist prophesied by the Bible in the book of Revelations!

Some just swear and others leave their invite codes (literally spam) so Google has a serious issue with QC of this department, heck, Amazon makes sure that the folks who review stuff on their website do not make these mistakes so come on, Google!Really hope that Google can clean up the reviews and make it more civilised on the Play Store.

I actually suggested two category listings ""Home Organisation"" and ""Property Staging"", as neither existed. google emailed me and the exchange continued for some time, yet it was them merely spinning me a yarn and lied to me. google had NO intention of creating the two suggested categories. As google deliberately FAIL to create the two categories my business is lumbered under ""cleaning""! When I receive enquiries from people who are looking for those services I then have to explain that I do not provide such services. Naturally, they are curious to know why my business is listed under ""cleaning"" to which I advise that google FAIL to create two relevant categories whist google simply and continuously lied to me.I realise there are other search engine options available, yet google has the monopoly.

google	Eric	2015-08-24T02:14:33Z	1	I have sent more than 30 emails to Martin & Co (Oxford) leasing co to address the failure of floor heating for 48 Empress Court, Woodins Way. Ox1 1HF. I received no actions and no replies. I walked to see them more than 6 times. From 29 Jan 2015 to 1 June 2015, we reported the failure of essential service of the floor heating on 29 Jan to 15 April 2015. My son suffered in cold winter for more than 3 months. The room temperature was continuously below -2 to 2 degree in month of Jan/ Feb 2015 and most of the nights were 0 deg C in March 2015. The technician took a month to order and replaced the thermostats, but it fails to work. He told me that, in Empress Court, many units have the same problem as electrical heating mat is not functioning, after 15 yrs. They cannot replace the mat by digging up the floor. The Manager,  Richard Goodwin has promised to compensate us £350 and said this is under his sole authorities, as we suffered more than 3 months of cold winter and also we have to buy a portable heater. After we checked out on June 15, 2015, he said that the landlord disagreed to pay. He has ignored all our calls and emails. Richard has a good win! Eric

google	Robert Iles Todd	2015-02-02T04:39:34Z	3	I'm no very hip to new web stuff but why would google stop supporting https in 2014.  Doesn't the 's' stand for security?  What is supplanting this function?  Also when i use google i get different results nearly everyday.  And when I use my wife's or someone elses device the results are so strangely different that... well here is an analogy.  It's like walking into a library (the bricks and mortar kind) and finding a whole new set-up every single day.  But then again i still like milk with my cookies... enough said... back to some real work now... peace

google	Jan Linslow	2014-11-01T18:56:12Z	5	Google is my choice for search. Sometimes I get peaved when my browser or my phone switches over to Yahoo search or Bing search. I don't want to search on Yahoo or Bing. Google is my preferred choice only because they are fast, efficient, and shows me exactly what I'm looking for when I'm looking for the information. Their ads sometimes freak me out a bit because it seems a little spooky what they know about me... but other than that... Google is one smart company and one smart search engine.
google	Shane	2014-10-29T21:10:21Z	3	I am not a fan of Google anymore.

google	Amelia Rayner	2014-08-07T16:28:39Z	1	From day one, I have had nothing but trouble with Google Chrome......I have spent months trying to figure out why my laptop was incrediably slow, not only that, had so many ads etc pop up. Everytime I went to log into my msn account, gambling pages etc would pop up. I also had random messages popping up saying that things were out of date etc, like Java. My laptop is brand new and I have only had it a few months. Anyway, today I uninstalled Google Chrome and installed Firefox instead which, thankfully, is so much better...I have already noticed a big difference. My laptop is so much faster and I havent had any adverts or anything pop up. So if there is one bit of advice I can give anyone, DO NOT HAVE GOOGLE CHROME ON YOUR LAPTOP.
google	Stop the scammers	2014-08-06T20:54:37Z	1	Google is OK but [external reference] has a better search engine.

google	James	2014-07-01T19:31:42Z	4	it is very easy to use, but sometimes the site bugs out
google	Jared P.	2014-06-12T11:22:09Z	4	I don't think I have to say anything about the importance of Google and bore everyone. Great search engine, constantly making changes without making it users hard to adapt to those changes. The only problem I have with Google is that the image search upload function is always making trouble on my Iphone.
google	Ian James	2014-06-04T03:03:54Z	3	On the plus, I love Google search, maps, calander, and docs.  I haven't had a chance to use their phone service, yet.  My big gripe with them now is the advertisements, and especially their Facebook wannabe Google+. Navigating through all the Google+ none sense has become a real pain when all you want is to check your e mail.Love the services you're good at Google.  Please just stick to those!
google	Bryan  Doull	2014-05-25T22:01:11Z	2	It has been over 30 days since I signed-up for the Google product Adsense and my account has neither been approved or denied. There is not anything in the help or support sections that I can use until Google tells me what is going on.Google makes it impossible to contact them directly and actively uses its technology to avoid interaction. I do not want you to just believe me. I want you to test the Google help and support features before you sign up for a Google program and see for yourself. Ask yourself- is this a level of support that is satisfactory for me? Google would rather customers rely on user forums for problem solving. Even if I give Google the benefit of the doubt and they just want customers to help each other to build some sort of peer team spirit, there are some very good reasons user forums are questionable for customer service.1. There is not any obligation on the part of other users to answer a question so many questions go unanswered.2. Many well meaning members of a user forum are not familiar enough with Google products or providing customer service and will give incomplete or overly technical answers that are useless to the help seeker.3. Google is weakening itself. Google.s competition could easily be monitoring Google's user forums for technical information and weaknesses in Google products that can be used to build something better. Making customers rely on each other makes it easy for them to give away valuable product details publicly. Frustrated customers are going to feel obligated to post the technical details of  the Google products they use all over the internet seeking help with their problem if Google does not provide direct product troubleshooting service of its own products. Thus, by providing poor customer service Google is pushing customers to give away its secrets.I was lucky, I found out about Google’s lack of customer service before I signed-up for a Google application that required a payment. What Google seems to be forgetting is that first impressions count for so much in business and there are now many others out there like me who may never trust Google with a paid product because of Google's attitude toward customer service.The other thing Google forgets is that my success using their application also allows Google to earn additional revenue.Hold on. Wow. Suddenly I am not so upset. Google's lack of customer service is costing them money as well. When I multiply it out for everyone Google is probably frustrating with its customer service policies, Google must be developing a serious revenue leak somewhere.Hey Google-let me remind you that there was another seemingly unstoppable internet powerhouse that failed because of poor customer relations as much as any other reason: AOL. Think about it.

google	duty yek	2014-03-17T00:07:21Z	5	Google is king when it comes to search engines. But it it so much more then that I am a big fan of many of the services Google offers. I have been using gmail since forever. I have Google phone for call and text. And the list goes on and on. There is not  enough time or space to express my love for all things Google.  I can hardly wait to try Google glass!
google	jean dup	2014-03-15T15:57:01Z	5	Google is one of the best search engines so far. I use it one a daily basis and find almost everything there.

google	Chase Spruill	2014-03-13T06:34:42Z	5	There is no question- Google is the ACME of our modern day.  They are the true future rulers of the world. From Google glasses - a computer on your face always.  To self - driving cars. to Google images - search for any image you want by picture or name, to facial recognition to artificial intelligence to robots. top operating systems that are taken over the entire world to the largest cell-phone system in the world.Oh and they've got a darn mean search site too.
google	Aaron Yiu	2014-03-08T00:37:19Z	2	Not cool.   Google tracks you all over the place so they can serve you up ads and barely says anything about it all in the very, very, very fine print hidden in their mammoth millions of pages.
google	Kyle Ervin	2014-02-27T04:05:27Z	5	Time and Time again, Google has provided me with information relevant to my search. Other search engines just don't compare in terms of layout, speed, and results. I can expect what I'm looking for to be within the first page of my search with Google. The other search engines just don't provide that kind of personalized accuracy. Even when searching for video or images, Google consistently provides a better ranking of the results in a much more clear and efficient manner. Sometimes the most well known company is always the best, in this case there isn't a better choice for your search engine. I will use Google until I'm 80 years old.
google	Sumit Goel	2014-02-24T10:40:17Z	5	No doubt Google is the best search engine. Almost it is the King of the Internet.
google	AJ	2014-02-23T16:54:20Z	5	I use it for everyday life. Whether it's for research, looking at pictures, or even fun, it's pretty much the only search engine you need nowadays. This website's come a long way from humble beginnings to be the #1 search choice worldwide.
google	Robert Burke	2014-02-15T12:59:05Z	5	"From their website: ""Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.""  Great search engine, and with any tool, the more you know about it, the better the results when using it.  Parents should look into Google extensive parental controls, to be sure that adult results are filtered better.  There is no way to remove all adult content, but the vast majority can be filtered.  Google has many tools, from local listings, drag and drop image searches and provide a variety of services for people and businesses."
google	Jens Riemann	2014-02-11T19:11:45Z	5	I use google for every kind of information I'm looking for. If I'm looking for a new haircut or if I just want to know which movie I'm looking for, it doesn't matter because Google always helps me immediately.To tell the truth, I don't now if I could manage my life without google as I do it right now. :p

google	JG1219	2013-09-30T21:06:30Z	5	I use this every time I need to search for something online. That could be from a song lyric that's stuck in my head to where to find the best restaurant in my neighborhood. The searches are generally fairly quick and bring up the information I need. I find Google's interface clean and simple, which I prefer.
google	John Creighton	2013-08-02T23:34:59Z	4	I use Google for nearly aspect of my professional life. I use Gmail for my email, Drive for document and picture savings, Calendar for scheduling and on and on. Analytics help find out my stats for websites. If Google were every shut down, I'm pretty sure my entire business life would go down the tubes. You'll find me talking to myself on the street trying to get it to work on cell phone. The only negative thing I can think about Google is that fact that I'm addicted to it like heroin.
google	CyndySix	2013-07-17T14:19:43Z	5	"Last night I was thinking about ""Google"" being like a word ""Windex"" or ""Kleenex"".  You never say ""I'm going to ""Yahoo"" it, or I'm going to ""Bing"" it (that might conjure up something weird!)  But everybody says ""I'm going to Google that"" and we all know exactly what they mean!  It's like if I say I ""Windexed"" the windows or I need a ""Kleenex"".  Everyone knows immediately what I'm talking about.""Google"" has obviously become the generic trademark for internet searches.  That's why I stick with the giant and biggest authority out there.  I trust Google to be the most vast, most knowledgeable, and most secure search engine out there.  Love it."

They can close your account without any other explanation than ""policy violation"" and they do not care if the mistake is yours or theirs.Try to Goggle(!) on ""google account suspended"".It is not only very small companies that get dumped. There are hundreds of companies who spent 100.000USD/year on Google-products who suddenly get their account closed without explanation.How much would it cost you if Google suddenly close your accounts?"

I was already thinking that it would be a long shot to get usefull help from such a big company as Google.That was quickly put to shame.Two hours later I got a call from Google support. I didn't have time, but they would call me back at any time that was convenient for me.So I scheduled a call for the next day and ended up getting 40+ minutes of personal support. Migrating my mails turned out to be quite a complex matter.So a big thanks to Sylwia from Enterprise Support, for being very helpful and very nice to talk to.

google	Brock Cooper	2012-10-23T03:02:42Z	5	When Google first became popular, I didn't really think much of them. I didn't like the enormity of the company and their offerings, but one day I decided to use Google Mail.Google Maps soon help me get where I was going. Google Docs helped me keep my PDFs and Docs safe from a damaged computer or disaster. Google Talk let me talk to my wife, family and clients. I have become a Googlephile and I love it. I can't imagine how my life would work without Google everything. Thank you Google for making my life easier and more connected.

google	Piper Westwood	2012-08-22T08:36:46Z	4	I'm been using Google for years from the everyday search engine to Google Places and more. The company has a lot of options, apps, services and more that help me in my everyday life, but sometimes when I do have problems it seems a little hard to get helpful answers to fixes to the problems. Still, its a good company that runs the gamut of services that make my life easier, so still a good company!
google	Jamie Anderson	2012-08-17T14:40:25Z	5	Obviously Google is the best search engine, but it's range of additional features and apps are what make it a real winner.I never use anything else!
google	Mona Kelly	2012-08-06T22:32:48Z	5	Really reliable and relevant searches. I doubt there is a company that could come up with a SE better than Google.
google	Customer: Prof. Brian Bevan	2012-08-04T09:40:22Z	5	Google: I could say a lot but to sum up so as not to bore ones readers. The top search system ( not just an engine)Superb Email joust! Prolific and simply superb Picasa. Sketchup beats the S%^& out of many professional cad programmes. Their mapping software another huge winner; and so it goes on. I love GOOGLE!
google	Gina Winston	2012-08-03T20:13:49Z	5	I haven't heard that any of my friends uses any browser other than Google. It is just way too superior.
google	Frank Adams	2012-07-28T16:48:23Z	5	Google is much better search engine than Yahoo or Bing, or any others. Run the search for any search term and you will see for yourself.
google	Patricia Young	2012-07-26T18:13:22Z	5	Gmail is an absolutely best mail service with its huge capacity, 100% uptime and loads of other utilities, all for free.
google	Michael Ferguson	2012-07-24T20:31:05Z	5	I don't waste my time trying to search for something on other search engines. Google is the only obvious and logical choice.
google	Azra Leith	2012-07-23T17:47:02Z	5	Definitely the best search engine out there. It sorts out the results in most relevant way.
google	Dani Lang	2012-07-23T12:55:43Z	5	no adverts and always gives me something I want.
google	Errol Lombard	2012-07-21T16:36:43Z	5	This is my favorite search engine.. Actually for a long time this is the only one that I use.

google	Maverick06	2012-07-18T15:50:24Z	1	I made an error & deleted my account. Submitted request for help never heard from Google. Can not find a person to help. Only forms and huge online library.
google	Dan. M	2012-07-18T14:50:57Z	5	When I first started using google, I used to get random ordered search lists that never contained what I was looking for, never got anything that was from my country and struggled to understand alot of what was in the search results...BUT NOW I use google nearly constantly for everything I need to find, whether that be music related news, weather, email or even gaming! Not only have they grown at an amazingly fast pace, but they have also become alot more user friendly and accessible to the public. I love all of the new features, including G+ (google+), which I myself use and have done since the days they were released!Google are much much better than their competitors which to me seem not to search for what your telling it to but to search instead for what they think you mean, which imo is rather annoying...Keep up the good work google!
google	Karen Green	2012-07-18T09:00:23Z	5	I won't use anything else..
google	Alexander  Vorobev	2012-07-17T22:53:14Z	5	Easy to find, exelent maps, best direction solutions, ans, of cause, I have GooglePhone!

google	Harshiran	2012-07-16T18:35:38Z	4	Google is like a magnifying glass you just ask for what you want and it just pops up in seconds.  What ever you want whenever you need it.  Even if its a question, if its maths you would type it in and it would probably pop up with a online virtual calculator how clever! Also the pick and drop a picture into the search box really helps.
google	Al	2012-07-16T18:17:17Z	5	Excellent services
google	Ken	2012-07-16T06:43:25Z	3	No operational issues and only two conditions I'm not completely happy with.  1:  If I wanted Crome, I would ask for it.  Quit trying to pass it off all the time.  2:  Censorship for political reasons, regardless of who's opinion it is, is NEVER in the best interest of the people.  For example, if you don't want to support ammunition sales for legal reason, then don't list those sites at all.  But singling them out becuse of someone in managements personal view of the issue is reprehensible!  Let people make up thier own minds
google	Willie White	2012-07-16T05:29:35Z	5	u can fine anything on google.
google	Jaume López	2012-07-16T00:30:34Z	4	Many people seem to start to believe Google has grown too much, it holds too much power in our lives. That's probably true. However, what's unquestionably true is that it still provides the absolutely best search results in the globe.
google	Donald Maynard	2012-07-15T14:59:42Z	5	I only use gmail for all my private and business needs. It is that good. And it never crashed on me.
google	David from Cornwall	2012-07-15T00:21:01Z	5	Always go on Google first to find any info

google	Beth	2012-07-14T12:22:50Z	5	This is the only search engine I use. It now has so many features, you really need nothing else! I love the maps section, I use it often for directions. The images section is great too. I also use the shopping section quite a lot which is good however I do find it inaccurate a lot of the time. Nevertheless it is the best search engine around and it's always been my homepage and probably always will be!!
google	Harold Crowe	2012-07-13T19:59:14Z	5	Anything you need to know place to go.
google	Jean Sarsby	2012-07-13T13:31:37Z	5	I couldn't be without it if there's anything I want I just type it in. Its a very helpful service.
google	Abdulla Ashoor	2012-07-13T00:55:30Z	5	The best web site in the world. Everything.. Everywhere
google	Kevin Hoang	2012-07-12T20:40:27Z	5	I'm a loyal fan of google. Everything from search engine to apps and social networking. They keep things very simple and straight forward but also detailed when needed. There apps prevent spams and not as much advertising as some other stuff I've used. Overall, I usually set every pc i use to google as homepage and usually install chrome since it amazingly sync all my bookmarks and such with a simple install and log on. Best stuff ever!
google	Jamie	2012-07-12T14:49:17Z	5	I can find exactly what I'm looking for everytime.
google	Anna C	2012-07-12T02:34:36Z	3	"...but they're getting worst and worst with every passing year. The latest is that they're charging to list products in their ""shopping"" results which is pretty gross considering. Plus with their blatant desperate attempts to integrate their crappy social network Google+ into search results, it just makes THEM and their results seems less relevant with every search. I think it's time for Google to sink a la myspace style and make room for the next big thing."
google	Jag	2012-07-11T23:45:33Z	5	Still the best and quickest
google	Nick Barnett	2012-07-11T19:39:27Z	1	No I don't want to search the world every time I'm looking for something.I just want things that are in the UK.
google	Lluis Massip	2012-07-10T18:47:59Z	5	I have tried almost all applications to create albums for the Web. Compared with JAlbum some are easier to use but it is profitable to devote two or three sessions to learn JAlbum thoroughly, then he discovers powerful options and practical features not found in more expensive commercial programs. I am very satisfied with the purchase although I have not experienced the sale of pictures and videos through PayPal, one of the distinctive possibilities of JAlbum. Very good!
google	Jane Pritchard	2012-07-10T17:50:15Z	5	Google is a briliant site for information. Whatever the subject of your enquiry, they can usually find a site to help you. There are so many ways that Google can help. It is very easy to navigate round their site and I would highly recommend them.
google	Martin Crocombe	2012-07-10T16:06:24Z	5	You've got to love Google how would we live without them
google	Sylvia Anderson	2012-07-10T12:18:18Z	5	Better than a library.  I can find out about almost any subject I want.
google	Johny Livinston	2012-07-10T05:11:27Z	5	Ever wondered expecting answers for whatever input you give?? Well, here it is, Google at its best. I use most od the services offered by Google and its product, Android. Am a fan of Android, especially its ICS OS. The customer service is best, because once when my account got deleted, they helped me out recover it back. Anyway, I think Google can place a download link in youtube, play store etc. That's my suggestion. Rather I would recommend this product to all.
google	Christine Hanner	2012-07-10T04:11:54Z	5	Google = where to find everything internet with no confusion or pop-ups!
google	Tess McIntyre	2012-07-09T21:51:21Z	5	Let's face it, without google we would be lost and have to rely on the likes of 'Bing' and what-not. Its easy to use, has all those extra apps for those of us who like to spice things up a bit and best of all does a good job.
google	BB	2012-07-09T20:15:56Z	5	what do we do when we dont know it, cant find it, argue about it and wish knew where to buy it? We google it.  what more can you say.

Even with book title and author's name, for example, I have difficulty getting to appropriate subject field.  Instead, there are wads of uninformative reviews of vaguely related matter which are of no use.

google	David Cook	2012-07-05T03:14:21Z	1	Still not bringing relevant search results to suit keyword queries any of the time.And charge businesses a fortune in the process.

google	Ms N Morney	2012-07-04T03:49:57Z	5	Google is my home page.  What more can I say?Their email service is very user unfriendly, but other than that all their services are amazing.
google	Mr Muscle	2012-07-03T23:54:01Z	1	I dont like Google as I believe that they are controlling what we see. I think they filter things according to a national mandate driven by a New World Order elite overseer. i think there is a massive conspiracy to manipulate traffic rankings and flows because traffic at the end of the day = power and they want to control who has that.

google	David Bond	2012-07-02T13:52:01Z	5	Well, there ARE other search engines but honestly, why would I bother? None offer the speed and interconnectivity that Google do, and the Chrome browser is the best out there.
google	Mary Ellen Bunyan	2012-07-02T13:45:51Z	5	I have tried many search engines and always come back to google. I use chrome and just google as i tend to keep my info pages seperate from my search pages and find that works well on my computer. Chrome is great for news links and things like my weather bug for llocal weather forcasts.  I have never had problems wit google on desktop, lap top, or tablets. One litle grumble i do have is that the corrective search gadget does tend to be way off sometimes. But that said it has made me moe precie in what i search.
google	JoAnna Benert	2012-07-01T18:03:37Z	5	Excellent service had no trouble finding things

google	Alex	2012-06-30T02:56:53Z	1	Great search engine. HOWEVER: They keep information on you based on your searches without telling you. They then use this information to direct adverts to you that they think you are likely to click on due to the previous searches. Should be more honest and less 'sneaky' for such a big company.
google	eamonn	2012-06-29T19:51:34Z	5	Search on Google hundred times a day and have a gmail account.  Never any problems with either.  Also Android OS is awesome!

google	ige	2012-06-28T01:12:38Z	3	but that's about it.  it often brings up completely unrelated stuff, but i guess that's part of the overflowing interweb.  i do really hate the fact that the company supports anti access radical groups.

Does it favor it's own websites like YouTube in search results? Probably? Is it going to take over the world so resistance is futile? Most likely? Do I like the fact that its innovative and forward thinking? Most definitely.

google	Rod Mitchell	2012-06-14T16:24:53Z	4	Google has a big head and they think they are the best of the best.  They need to wake up and realize they are NOT the best.  Google Mail absolutely sucks.   I've seen Chinese websites that offer super mail with many options and Google only offers the bare minimum.   I love Google Earth and Google Maps.   I rarely use Google to search and they really should make their home page better.  Come on Google, you're supposed to be an upbeat and cool company.  Improve your mail and make Google the best.   Are you really going to let the Chinese beat you?

It is a brilliant search engine and the only one I need to use. It is always my first stop to compare anything or find anything. Like the name Hoover is a synonym for vacuum, I think Google is a synonym for find!But of course it does not stop there with all the other services like Gmail and Googlemaps...... brilliant

google	Drew Long	2012-04-15T03:06:13Z	1	I used to love Google, used to.....hate it now. Since when do they have my permission to use my Zip and City as a standard for searches? Its supposed to be a search engine not a collar or a USA Spy-Satelite. They went to far and are pushy invaders, like fire ants or crab grass. Not only that their searches are biased and paid for by the people with the top listings, does that say fair or how about honest?Then they turn around and sell your info, I am sure to other companies for profit.....what else do they need to invade you for? Not for polls or truth. You can Suck it, and stick GOOGLE Chrome up your HTTP ASSHOLE~!

google	Kim Belsey	2012-04-13T00:28:46Z	4	I have Google as my default browser page search engine.Great except fer a few things ......The site will not keep to your choices ,as with ...once entering the UK pages, UK only that is all I want to see, but other countries ,mainly the US still appear mixed in.I am sure google blocks my access to some sites with code excuses.Overall I think considering all its tools and speed, its still my choice,it can only get better ?????

google	Vickie Dao	2012-04-08T21:20:12Z	5	I love the Google calendar, which is universally used on most web sites.  Also their Google Voice has no challenge in the world, for what it can do and is free at the same time.

google	Steven Nybo Andersen	2012-03-29T08:34:17Z	3	Google is fine as long as you know that for every search you'll trade a bit of your privacy. I finally found some other search engine that does respects my privacy and are no longer using google except  in rare circumstances. Google is WAY too big to care about peoples privacy now as long as they earn money. Google makes a personalized profile of your personality through your searches and then it only offers results that it knows would please you, letting any upsetting search result behind. It's definitely not objective and transparent. Gmail is still great though.

google	Shepard Ofpeace	2012-03-24T19:59:10Z	2	You can't have a Youtube account unless you have a gmail account.  They've gotten rid of friends and turned them into subscriptions.  My friends have disappeared and seemed to be lost from my subscriptions and I don't recall anyone asking me if that was ok.  And they're new my channel set up sucks.  I was asked if I wanted to switched, I said no, I back weeks later to find it has been changed.On google plus you are required to use a real name.  Why can't I use shepard of peace?  What if I don't want people to know my real name?  What if I don't want current or future employers to find me on google+?  Why can't I decide what is best for me?Google gmail's new page is slower and harder to see.  Luckily though I have been allowed to switch back to the old format.I don't like having my browser history stored online, luckily you can turn that off, but for those who do not know how to turn this off and may not know it is being stored online, this is not fair to them.People do business with people.  Google has gotten to big and is no longer a person but a business.  Its concern is not the customer but the profits.

google	Leo M	2012-03-22T18:38:04Z	1	"Google has a very friendly relationship with a website called Ripoff Reports, which is trying to extort my company into paying them to ""resolve"" a negative review. Ripoff Reports is harming my company, and Google is helping them by allowing them to buy top rankings in the search results. Rand Fishkin, a well known SEO Expert, has reported on this scam. He says Google's actions here are quite suspect."
google	Robert Jennings	2012-03-22T15:28:14Z	4	Google just has the best results. You kind of wish a cooler, non-corporate alternative would come along, but so far no luck. And Bing is not a serious option!

There is no privacy concerns. They are just giving you more targeted ads? Why is everyone hating? Almost every Google product out there is awesome.

google	Paulo Rodrigues	2012-03-14T20:02:21Z	5	I am an old user of Google products and since the time I started to use firstly the search tool, it's getting better over the time with new and useful products. I use them mainly to help find what I want and need but also Gmail, Google Docs, Google Maps and Picasa. Also refer the low prices of space allocation compared to rivals. I will always prefer Google if they stay so innovative as they have been.
google	Jake	2012-03-14T18:56:09Z	5	"It speaks for itself whenever you no longer refer to searching on the internet, but ""googling"". Top notch search engine, very popular email service (which I can't comment on further since I don't actively use it) but they really flopped with their social networking site. But did they really need that anyway?"

google	epoussif	2012-03-14T09:10:37Z	3	I'm a google fan. I use it every day, I think around fifty times per day. But didn't you feel that in the recent times, every search results too much in stupidities? Also the commercial links, I mean, if you choose to search in Shopping, it's right, but if you want reviews, descriptions, etc.. Even to find the official website of anything, it's getting really hard. There was too much tricks developed by the web providers (hosting places, web developers, entire books about it) and the result is that google is too much less useful as ever before. No replacement by now, but needed, and sooner or later something will come, if they don't react in time.

google	Peter Crosskey	2012-03-12T21:35:48Z	4	"Since I first knew the internet without any search engines that really stood up to close examination, how can I begin to explain the value of a one-stop shop that defines what today's web user will find (or not)? It's a big responsibility and the next ten years won't be as straightforward as the past ten. But whatever happens ot the desktop environment during that time, Google will be out there supporting the majority platform. So that's web Portal with a capital ""P"". And singular."

google	Louise	2012-03-10T20:17:12Z	3	Works very well but there are competitors in the field who won't trample your privacy. Google chrome is acceptable but not outstanding (although it does have built-in spell corrector). Gmail is very good, I would recommend that.
google	Rebecca	2012-03-10T19:12:34Z	4	When you're looking for something; you google it. There is a reason for this. The easiest of all the online search engines, google is fantastic for searching for broad ideas or concepts. However, if you are wanting to find something very specific, or profession based, you can be stuck searching through hundreds of links that have no real relevance, or you could have only one or two links instead of the wealth of information you normally associate with google.
google	Scott	2012-03-09T15:43:45Z	5	Google offers clients with many free services and the ability to market businesses effectively and cheaply.  I would recommend their marketing to anyone.  It has worked well for myself.In addition services like google voice are a fantastic free service that people should give a try to and experiment with.

google	Osmanthus Satoria	2012-03-01T14:21:40Z	5	"Great humanity shown in its products, knowing what human need and design everything for ""people"". There is no other company like Google, no other search engine cares what you actually are looking for like Google does.I have been using Google for 11+ years since i had my first laptop, and am spoiled because I always get what i am looking for before I finish my keywords.Google search makes keyword search an Art. I was almost addicted to the beauty of getting what you want by the best keywords combination. I like how I beat myself, and I like how Google surprises me by giving me something out of expectation -- yet related.Search engine opens up my world. It shows you how much 1 word means, and how 1 word x 1 word can be bigger than 1 Million. Gmail is one brilliant product. It shows you how to think out of the box, and you can always make sth better, make ""unlimited"" possible. Since then we have Google Docs, Google Maps, Google Translate. Not just by using them -- they teach me new concepts by being a google product itself. Search for ""Google Translate"" and you will learn about ""statistical machine translation"". I want to know how I get my results when I search it for different purposes, and I want to learn the brilliant ideas behind it -- it looks 100% random, but it isn't. It cares if I get the best of what i need before I realized it.Love Google, 'causeit makes life beautiful."

I called up to get new filters and they told me how to maintain my machine, which was great. The good deal was that 3 years after I bought my machine they sent me a free one year membership in their alkaline lifestyle health community. Great information on having a healthier lifestyle!

This is my disillusionment with their technological forays - specifically Android related. Google blatantly stole - LIFTED - code directly from Java (Oracle/Sun) and was caught in emails red-handed as daredevils.  Rather than try to be original, they try to reverse-engineer everything Apple - kind of like what Microsoft did with Windows.  I also believe in Karma - what you sew you reap.  Windows is finally suffering that fate.  Will Google?  Time will tell, now won't it?"

google	Matthew	2012-02-10T20:10:55Z	5	well you could ask for a lot. but google seems to deliver what you want, but didn't think about first. and if you did think about it first, they deliver on time. what a great company. i would like a job there too; i'm unemployed :'(
google	Berry Smith	2012-02-09T18:27:07Z	1	Google's new privacy policy sold us out. Do no evil. ha
google	Julie Hunt	2012-02-09T16:13:31Z	5	Still the best online search engine quick and efficient exactly what says it does on the tin !

google	kiandra99	2012-02-07T22:29:09Z	5	I find this free service much easier to use than Telstra.(In an effort to extract as much money as possible from the user Telstra is inflexible, awkward and slow.)Google is seamless. It is like stepping through an open door to another world. There are more free services available than I can use. Looking at some of them definitely expands my horizon of the possible. Even better it is always secure. I don't think I could ever use all the available storage.
google	Windsordane	2012-02-07T07:44:13Z	3	I wish they would understand that I'm happy with MSN and stope bothering me with emails

google	Karla black	2012-02-03T18:59:44Z	1	Google really messed up this time. Do no evil.. yeah sure. They know everything about us! they just build up their database of all our transactions. Wonderful!
google	Garry B	2012-02-03T13:25:31Z	5	Please stop messing about with everything..... and why is it so hard to link all my google products together properly..... and why are you forcing me to have a very very very poor layout in gmail.... I loved the old waystill love u tho
google	Dimitris	2012-02-03T11:55:32Z	4	...but they shouldn't have changed their privacy policy. I hope they make up their minds, and change it back (but I doubt so)
google	tadams	2012-02-03T05:27:38Z	5	still the best, but I'm concerned about privacy issues. Google is getting scary.

google	Robin and thanks for your order	2012-02-02T11:01:11Z	4	Google are great but i wish they would not keep altering the site page so often i had just got used to it when they chanmged every thing
google	Micksifon	2012-02-02T10:15:17Z	5	I love Google, it's my home screen, I use it all the time and it makes things beautifully easy. I've not used an address bar in years, or a map! I love Google Maps, I don't understand people who own a Tom-Tom and have maps on their phone. I have admit I don't see the point in Google+, like anyone was gonna start allover again after the investment we all made in Facebook. And I was it would stop telling me to download Chrome, when I'm already a Safari user! But these are silly issues and with the amount they try to do, of course things are gonna be......wrong. Love Google!
google	Kevin Hengst	2012-02-02T09:51:56Z	2	While their software seems to be good and their services convenient, the fact that they went out of their way to fire a good engineer just because he was stating a few facts when requested to do so... it's terrible. I have very little trust in Google now.
google	Austen	2012-02-01T20:08:10Z	5	Google is my life. Homepage, Android, CloudPrint, ect. :) Love it.
google	joannaK	2012-02-01T18:20:46Z	5	all the privacy issues with google brought them down a star. I love the dearch, but dont support the privacy and censorship they support. Information should be free, this is not china, FREEDOM OF INFORMATION!:)
google	Stuart	2012-02-01T15:28:43Z	4	Never a day passes when I don't use google at least 10 times
google	htsetr	2012-02-01T14:40:35Z	4	search is definitely the choice, however the adwords fees keep increasing over the years as the bids will only go up but not down.  my advertising fees had increased 50% from year 2007 to last year 2011.  this is kinda a cheat but too bad there is no much other online advertising competitors that can beat google
google	Tom Fitzherbert	2012-02-01T03:55:03Z	5	Still has the best results, but their new privacy policy of tracking people everywhere they go on the web is a little too Big Brother. Hopefully someone will challenge them soon.
google	Terry Seal	2012-01-31T14:38:43Z	5	I started using other sites, but found google is the one with the answers. The engine picks more answers to your quest then other sites do. Typing in a few characters gets you choices before you have finished the line. So some slate Google about spying, but all of the sites use cookies and unless you delete your cookies. then you are already on someones database. I find sites that ask too many personal questions are not for me. Google is a search engine and a program not a person. So if you want to find it use google.
google	jay	2012-01-31T03:06:05Z	5	Best search engine there is. 100
google	Mervin	2012-01-30T15:32:45Z	5	Really nice website

google	Jeremy	2012-01-29T20:31:14Z	5	Google, really, what CANT you do?? All the search results i want, the android operating system, Google mail, Monopoly anyone?I love Google, and always will. And their recent stand against the two outrageous Piracy acts just shows that these guys care about their users just as much as anyone else.Cheers.

Thank you to the brainiacts!  <---if that is mispelled, it's cause I don't  have spell check here!  LOLThank you Google!Debbie"
google	Robert White	2012-01-29T15:05:29Z	3	I like the old Google.  I do not like the new Google.  The new Google was forced upon me without my will.   Furthermore, there is almost no way to communicate with Google for help in emergencies.  My account was hacked, re “pinned” and messages sent to my addressees asking for money.   Contacting Google was a nightmare.
google	Stephen Richards	2012-01-29T11:17:41Z	4	It took a long while for me to finally give in and swap search engine providers to Google. I mainly moved as it was everywhere I looked on any decice I used. As a search engine they are great, but lets not forget that is all they are and should concentrate on this. I have a Samsumg Galaxy Nexus and this phone has been ruined by Google and their silly power struggles. The phones no longer sync with Facebook because Google did not want them to. Google is starting to look very silly indeed. If they do not concentrate on their core business then their profits will continue to slide.
google	George Bryans	2012-01-28T18:59:24Z	5	Need a definition, convert grams into ounces, find anything you are looking for, what more is there to say other than it is the best search engine out there and its FREE
google	Sebastien Rose	2012-01-28T09:55:56Z	3	Still be best all-round search engine.Shopping searches often return fake websites based far away around the world and scammers trying to get your money. Google get your act together and don't support these bogus websites!

google	Annie Shakespeare-Bishop	2012-01-21T14:17:44Z	5	The first place for me is Google.   I use it all the time to check on spellings, product information, translations, geographical questions. Google answers the lot!I also look forward to the different Google illustrations.
google	JLow	2012-01-21T14:00:08Z	5	You really only need 1 site/tool for everything these days.
google	Sharon Loken	2012-01-21T05:55:57Z	5	Want to know about something ???  Go to Google.  They seem to have one of the best ways to communicate with folks on the computer.  I try Google first ...  only if I do not get an answer I look elsewhere.  THANKS GOOGLE !!
google	Joshua	2012-01-21T04:55:22Z	5	I don't know what I would do without Google.  The shopping, video, and image tabs make it easy for me to get what I want and Google always has the most relevant sites at the top of the list.

google	Shawna	2012-01-20T04:39:38Z	4	Google is my favorite search site because it always shows me what I am looking for.  The pictures are the best and it makes it easy by condensing the pictures into smaller icons enabling you to search through them faster.
google	Peter Risley	2012-01-19T19:31:24Z	5	Brilliant as always
google	Julchen	2012-01-19T12:21:14Z	4	let´s be honest, google is integrated in our lives and I love ebing able to search for anything - AND most properly find it. That´s great! you can prepare vacations and already know everything about the local restaurants of the place you wnat to go before hand. But please, please take our privacy serious!
google	Michael Hetherington	2012-01-19T08:58:43Z	5	The only search engine for me - I have tried the rest but keep coming back to Google

google	John	2012-01-17T16:56:59Z	5	PhysioRoom has a broader product range than many other sites at very competitive prices.  Delivery is fast and efficient.
google	KEITH	2012-01-17T10:52:02Z	5	Original and best.... IMO. literally got the T- shirt which I won about 10 years ago in a search competition  about 10 years ago (just after they started)
google	John	2012-01-17T09:29:41Z	1	It's time for a change, Google has become stale and boring. The same old logo with the bright colours that treat us like we are still five. It's old and badly needs to update it's image.Plus when you are looking for things it's clear that Google put way too much emphasis on the paid advertising which is a real shame. Search engines should be a way to find things, not pushing crap products they advertise.
google	susan	2012-01-17T07:03:20Z	5	great site. I can always find what I'm lookingfor.
google	Mark Anthony	2012-01-16T19:47:17Z	5	Always have the greatest search results! cant ctand using other search engines

google	JDF	2012-01-15T22:16:19Z	5	Google is one of the best search engines on the net simple to use and gives very intuitive suggestions as you type meaning quite often you only need the first few letters of what your looking for. Also good for email and have done an ace job of the Android OS for smartphones
google	Derek	2012-01-14T23:41:21Z	5	People need to understand, if it isn't on Google, it doesn't exist.

google	James Stephens	2012-01-13T14:30:36Z	5	Whether it's familiarity or what, I cannot bring myself to use any search engine but Google, I can't find fault.  I also use Google for email, and yet again the service is faultless.  Thank you Google.
google	Stephen	2012-01-13T11:39:20Z	5	From search through android to online word processing, this company is the best.  They put microsoft to shame.
google	Jimmy	2012-01-13T01:45:27Z	4	Some new features make the king of searches almost too quick for it's own good - it tries to anticipate your question while your typing and sometimes gives different results if you try the same question twice within a few minutes.

google	Clubmeber	2012-01-10T19:49:43Z	5	No matter what it is I'm searching, google is never far away! I find google really easy to use, its got many different 'apps' attached to it, for example maps, url shortener, images etc. As a search engine it's brilliant - It also allows other programs to feed in to it, for example internet security such as AVG support it. And it's a friendly face when in the need to search for something.

google	Mr John Roberts	2011-12-13T09:30:19Z	1	Google Instant is rubbish and impossible to turn off easily.  Google know it's not liked but insist on forcing it on people.

google	peter francis	2011-11-27T22:45:10Z	5	I can't begin to state the wealth of useful information this site has given me. I rarely turn to any other search engine for facts. I am constantly amazed just how many facts are stored on the site and I have yet to ask a question that is not answered logically, clearly, and in depth. A very dear person has just been told she has ovarian cancer and I have been able to reassure her about many questions relating to this dreadful cancer through answers given on Google.
google	ShakeS12	2011-11-27T14:40:51Z	5	Been using Google for years now, and have found them to be the best search engine. Now with Google Chrome, put the two together and you have the best, fastest, web browser on the market. Awesome job.
google	Paul Morriss	2011-11-27T10:17:24Z	5	Google changed the world of search, they made it simple more relevant and more comprehensive - no other search engine to date can compete.  Bing from Microsoft and Yahoo - just don't get it, they can't compete because they are trying to do to many things, they are portals not search engines and whilst it is OK for them do search they will never offer a pure service built on improving search results like Google will.Google stays true to its core value of providing quick, relevant search results enabling you to get what information you want quickly.

google	Terry	2011-10-22T16:48:06Z	3	"After many years of using Google Search, I've found the ability for Google to intelligent suggest alternative variations and correct spelling mistakes to facilitate my search to be useful.However, when using Google Search for looking up certain niche topics or even quite specific searches, Google Search overrides your query and the pages often do not contain elements the original search terms.Should you check the cache, you will often be confronted with a message telling you that pages linking to this page contain your search query while the page you end up on does not and that's if you're lucky!I would appreciate a simple check box that performs a verbatim search for the exact words that I type in. No automatic ""behind the scenes"" suggestions, no dropping very important search words, no replacing ""GLSL"" with ""HLSL"" behind my back for example, and so on.Just a ""Give me what I asked for exactly"" option for those specific times! Please."

google	Ian Huntsman	2011-08-22T10:27:47Z	4	Best search engine by far . One star dropped as when searching for a specific company it would be good if the search results always showed the searched company's homepage as the very first result .
google	M Pearson	2011-08-21T21:48:23Z	3	I don't like the way they show pop ups asking to be your home page. Once is perhaps ok but now every time? They need to get humility and back off, if I want them as my home page I'll do it in my own sweet time.
google	Mr Chris Palmer	2011-08-20T19:18:24Z	5	Sheer brilliance!

google	Loutjie Lolo	2011-08-16T15:26:22Z	3	I do use Google search at work but I prefer ask.com. Information appears better on Ask and its like Google decides what it wants to show you, not what you are looking for. But still its great from where we have come from. Wouldnt live without the search engines

It has remained my preferred search engine (and default homepage) since I first discovered it.The reason why I love Google is because of its minamilistic homepage and the innovative use of the 'Google' logo at times, speed of search results, and integration with various applications I use.

google	Dan Martin	2011-05-20T10:16:56Z	5	These guys are soon going to be making and providing all our services from phones to entertainment to food delivery.Google is the largest and most widespread company I can think of on the internet; and off of it - to cover all grounds from email (Gmail), photos (picasa), maps (earth), social (buzz), tv (GoogleTV), translate (Translate), operating systems (ChromeOS), mobiles (Android)... and the list goes on and on.Im not going to say too much; out of all their products I use GMail, Android and their world-class search engine the most. In which I've never been let down. The only thing is I personally don't like the new Google Image search; but I'm sure this will become better once we're all using faster internet providers.Good luck to Google - and I hope they bring us many more great products in the future.

Its like saying that if you have no friends on Facebook than you have no friends in life. We need to get away from Google and use hundreds of tools that doesn't belong to Google.

It is way safer and much more convinent than giving your credit card to every company you want to shop from on the net. If you have the option to use them do. they follow up quickly ensure your order was recieved costmer service is awsome and hopefully they will blow paypal out of the market. Google in my oppinion has exceled in every venture that I know about and this is just one more great product they offer to the world. Go get'em google.
